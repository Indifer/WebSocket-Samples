#WebSocket Samples
This repository is a collection of WebSocket samples for .NET 4.5

#Getting Started
To be able to compile and run you will need the [Windows 8 developer preview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516). I covered the setup process in detail here: <http://www.paulbatum.com/2011/09/getting-started-with-websockets-in.html>


#Other Samples
If you are looking for the samples that Stefan and I demonstrated in our [BUILD 2011 talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/SAC-807T), these have their own repositories:

* [BUILD 2011 WebSocket Chat Samples](https://github.com/paulbatum/BUILD-2011-WebSocket-Chat-Samples)
