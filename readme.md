#WebSocket Samples
This repository is a collection of WebSocket samples for .NET 4.5

##Getting Started
To be able to compile and run you will need the [Windows 8 developer preview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516). Detailed instructions on the setup process are [here](http://www.paulbatum.com/2011/09/getting-started-with-websockets-in.html).

##Included Samples

### ASP.NET WebSocket Echo
The AspNetWebSocketEcho sample is a simple WebSocket echo server implemented using an IHttpHandler.
